New information

## Subheading addition
Added this subheading on the local machine


## Some basic commands
git clone - to get the repo on your local machine

git status - tells you whats up with git at the moment

git commit - allows you to commit changes. with a -m in the terminal you can add the commit message header and the second -m the commit message details

git push - allows you to push your changes to the cloud.

## To generate SSH keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "insert git email address here"
then give it a name/file in which to save the key
give the passphrase (not mandatory)

open the .pub key and then copy it in the github window for key generation.

next step is to add the ssh key to the local machine... we will look at this later.
